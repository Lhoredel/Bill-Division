# Bill-Division
This code solves the Bill Division problem (also known as "Bon App√©tit") where two friends split a restaurant bill, but one item wasn't consumed by one of them. The code calculates the fair share by summing all items except the one one person didn't eat, then checks if the charged amount matches the actual fair share or outputs the refund difference.
